# Eyes

DESCRIPTION 
This web page has two eyes that follow your mouse movement. The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye” element displayed on the page.

SKILLS 
This activity demonstrates bringing together skills in JavaScript and CSS to create this dynamic experience. 

HOW TO RUN
With the web page open move your mouse around the screen. The eyes will appear to follow the mouse as if they are watching what it is doing.

ROADMAP 
Future improvements will include a textured background that will look like monster fur or scales, and other facial elements that respond to mouse events including a nose that moves when when the mouse travels over it and a mouth that responds when the page is clicked.
